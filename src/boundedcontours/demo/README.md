This directory contains code useful for demonstrating and testing. To demonstrate that the mean squared integrated error is lower for bounded than normal smoothing for a bunch of distributions and settings, run:
```python
python mean_integrated_squared_error.py
```
If you want plots, run:
```python
python mean_integrated_squared_error.py --plot_example
```
For more options, run:
```python
python mean_integrated_squared_error.py --help
```
