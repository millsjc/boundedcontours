This package provides tools for creating 2D contour plots with additional capabilities beyond those offered by the standard corner.py library. Featuring:

1. **Smoothing with conditions:** Gaussian smoothing for 2D histograms, with the capability to apply smoothing while obeying specific conditions such as boundaries. This is useful for smoothing data that is bounded, such as and m1 and m2 masses of a binary black hole system, where m1 > m2. The condition is enforced by simply renormalizing the Gaussian kernel to account for the fact that the kernel is being truncated at the boundary.
